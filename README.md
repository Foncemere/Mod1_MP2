The component's name is App. 
I have 2 hooks, one for the birthday and one for the name, the age is 1 by default, and Sir Pad’s baby because I got nothing else to think about.
First is the text input where the name can be placed.
Next is the display of the name and age.
Then a button who’s function will concat the array (replace the old array with the new array).
Then a flatlist as requested to show all the ages it went through. renderItem will render the components of the list
 
Note I did not do a new age variable as it is just easier to put it directly, and there’s no need for it.
The <Name /> will appear only if the kid reaches the age 4 or up.
